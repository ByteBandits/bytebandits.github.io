He loves solving and creating puzzles. He is invited by Pied Diaper Inc. for some testing. You join him for this technical expedition. At the site, you watch him work for a few minutes, when he exclaims, \"What an idiot!\". Then, he looks at you with a with a playful gaze.

The friend is an expert in \"Penetration Testing\" which suggests that the system is vulnerable. We start by looking at:</p>\n<p>/etc/passwd\n/etc/shadow</p>\n<p>We find 7 users and sha512crypt passwords. We then use a dictionary attack to bruteforce the ciphers for 7 users listed in the files above. Using a relatively large dictionary of frequent passwords we can easily crack 1 set of credentials :</p>\n<p>gohan:dragon1:16816:0:99999:7:::</p>\n<p><img src=\"screen1.png\" alt=\"Cracked Users\"></p>\n<p>The flag is the password : \"dragon1\"</p>"}}
